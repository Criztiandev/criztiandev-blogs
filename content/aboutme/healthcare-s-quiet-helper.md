I've worked on systems that handle **controlled substance prescriptions** and patient data for thousands of people. It's humbling to know that somewhere, a patient got their medication on time because of code I helped write.

Healthcare tech isn't glamorous. It's strict regulations, HIPAA compliance, and 10,000+ record migrations from Excel spreadsheets. It's rebuilding legacy 2FA systems and ensuring that every line of code meets compliance standards.

But when you realize that your work helps:

- Doctors prescribe medication safely
- Patients access their health records
- Hospital systems run smoothly for 10,000+ users

...suddenly, all those compliance checks and security protocols feel worth it. It's a reminder that code can make a real difference in people's lives, even if they never see the developer behind it.
