Some of my best code solutions come during **random walks around the neighborhood**. There's something about fresh air and movement that untangles the messiest bugs in my head.

I've solved:

- Complex architecture decisions while circling the block
- Stubborn TypeScript errors during sunset strolls
- Database optimization strategies on early morning walks
- UI/UX design challenges while watching people go about their day

The science makes sense: physical movement increases blood flow to the brain, and stepping away from the screen gives your mind space to process things differently. But it feels like magic every time.

My walking routine:

1. **Encounter a bug** that won't budge after hours at the keyboard
2. **Get frustrated**, close the laptop
3. **Go for a walk** with no specific destination
4. **Let my mind wander** - no podcasts, no music, just thoughts
5. **Eureka moment** usually hits around the 15-minute mark
6. **Rush back** to implement the solution

It doesn't work every time, but it works often enough that walking has become part of my debugging toolkit.
