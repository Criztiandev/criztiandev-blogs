Despite working with AI integrations, HIPAA-compliant systems, and blockchain platforms, I'm still learning something new every day. The more I code, the more I realize how much I don't knowâ€”and honestly, that's what keeps it exciting.

**Things I'm still figuring out:**

- How to write truly "clean" code (it's subjective, fight me)
- The right balance between over-engineering and under-engineering
- When to use which database (it's not always "just use Postgres")
- How to estimate project timelines accurately (still failing at this)
- The best way to structure a large codebase

**Things I've accepted:**

- I'll never know everything, and that's okay
- The "best practice" changes every year
- Imposter syndrome is just part of the job
- Asking questions is a strength, not a weakness
- Sometimes "good enough" really is good enough

**The paradox:** The more experience I gain, the less confident I feel. But that's because I now understand the complexity I didn't see as a beginner. And that awareness makes me a better developer.

**So here I am:** Building things, breaking things, learning from both, and staying curious. Still figuring it out, one commit at a time.
