I've been fortunate enough to win a few hackathons, including a **$5K prize** competing against 500+ developers. What I love most isn't the winningâ€”it's the **48-hour coding marathons** fueled by curiosity and too much coffee.

There's something magical about the pressure of building something from scratch in a weekend. The late-night debugging sessions, the eureka moments at 3 AM, and the camaraderie with fellow developers pushing their limits.

Some of my proudest hackathon wins:

- **Dumpet.Fun**: $5K prize winner among 500+ entries for a decentralized contest platform
- **Everlink**: 1st place for a blockchain-based link-in-bio service
- **IWorkspace**: Productivity platform that caught the attention of early adopters

The real prize? The skills I learned, the people I met, and the proof that I can build something meaningful under pressure.
