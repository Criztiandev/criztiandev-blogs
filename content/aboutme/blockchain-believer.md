I've dabbled in **Web3 and decentralized platforms**, winning hackathons for projects like **Dumpet.Fun** and **Everlink**. I'm still figuring out this space, but I love exploring how blockchain can solve real-world problems.

Here's what I've learned so far:

- **Blockchain isn't just cryptocurrency** - It's about decentralization, transparency, and ownership
- **Smart contracts are fascinating** - Code that runs without intermediaries
- **The ecosystem moves fast** - What's cutting-edge today is old news tomorrow
- **There's still so much to learn** - And that's exciting

My Web3 projects:

- **Dumpet.Fun**: Decentralized contest platform with blockchain-based voting ($5K prize winner)
- **Everlink**: Permanent profile accessibility using Arweave storage (1st place)
- Various experiments with Solana, smart contracts, and decentralized storage

Am I a blockchain expert? Not yet. But I'm curious, I'm building, and I'm learning. That's enough for now.
