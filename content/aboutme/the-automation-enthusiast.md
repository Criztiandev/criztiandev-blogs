My love for automation once led me to build a script that **migrated 10,000+ records** just to avoid doing it manually. I guess you could say I'm **productively lazy**â€”I'll spend hours automating a 5-minute task.

Here's my philosophy: If I have to do something more than twice, it deserves a script.

Some of my favorite automation projects:

- **Excel to database migration script** - Saved countless hours of manual data entry
- **Automated payment scheduling system** - Helped users never miss a payment
- **CI/CD pipelines** - Because manual deployments are so 2010
- **Custom testing protocols** - Let the robots find the bugs

The best part? That initial 10 hours spent on automation pays dividends forever. Plus, there's something deeply satisfying about watching a script do in seconds what would take days manually.

Is it efficient? Probably not always. Is it fun? Absolutely.
