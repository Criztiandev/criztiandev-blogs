I once migrated an entire mobile app from Expo to native development builds to fix performance issues. It wasn't glamorous, but it taught me that sometimes you have to rebuild things from scratch to make them better.

The challenge was real:

- Compatibility issues across platforms
- Third-party library conflicts
- Build configuration nightmares
- Testing on real devices vs simulators

But the results were worth it:

- Dramatically improved performance
- Better native module integration
- Resolved platform-specific bugs
- Smoother user experience

**The lesson:** Sometimes the hard way is the right way. Taking shortcuts might get you there faster, but rebuilding with the right foundation pays off in the long run.
