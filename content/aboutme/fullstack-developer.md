## Theoria Medical

As a Fullstack Developer at Theoria Medical, I worked on critical healthcare systems that handle controlled substance prescriptions and patient data.

**Key Achievements:**

- Migrated critical OTP system for controlled substance prescriptions, ensuring compliance with state regulations and HIPAA requirements
- Automated 10K+ record migration from Excel to database using custom scripts, reducing manual processing time
- Rebuilt legacy 2FA system with enhanced security implementation featuring role-based access control and audit logging
- Integrated multiple third-party APIs for e-prescribing, identity verification, and provider management with error handling and failover systems
