When I'm not writing code, I enjoy creating pixel art and experimenting with 3D rendering. It's my way of staying creative and reminding myself that not everything needs to be optimized or efficient.

**Pixel Art** - There's something meditative about placing pixels one by one:

- Character sprites and game assets
- Retro-style illustrations
- Experimental abstract designs

**3D Rendering** - Learning Blender and exploring 3D design:

- Simple modeling projects
- Material and lighting experiments
- Procedural generation techniques

These creative outlets remind me why I fell in love with computers in the first place - the ability to create something from nothing. Plus, they scratch the same problem-solving itch as coding, just with different constraints.
