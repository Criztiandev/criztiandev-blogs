I take my sleep and food very seriously. A good meal and solid 8 hours are non-negotiable for me. I've learned the hard way that debugging on an empty stomach or exhausted brain is a recipe for disaster.

**My Sleep Philosophy:**

- 8 hours minimum, no exceptions
- Consistent sleep schedule (even on weekends)
- No coding right before bed (well, I try)
- The best debugging happens after a good night's sleep

**My Food Rules:**

- Never skip meals during heavy coding sessions
- Proper lunch break away from the screen
- Snacks within arm's reach (healthy ones... mostly)
- Good food = good mood = good code

**Why this matters:** I used to pull all-nighters and skip meals, thinking I was being productive. Spoiler: I wasn't. The bugs I created while exhausted took twice as long to fix. Now I prioritize rest and food, and my code quality has never been better.

**The irony:** Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is step away from the keyboard and take care of yourself.
