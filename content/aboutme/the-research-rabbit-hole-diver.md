I love reading and researching random topicsâ€”from new AI models to obscure programming paradigms. I can spend hours going down Wikipedia or documentation rabbit holes just because something caught my interest.

**My favorite rabbit holes:**

- New AI model releases and their capabilities
- Obscure programming languages and their design decisions
- Database internals and query optimization strategies
- Browser rendering engines and how the web actually works
- System design patterns from big tech companies

**The process:**

1. Encounter an interesting concept or technology
2. "I'll just quickly Google this..."
3. 47 browser tabs later
4. 3 hours have passed
5. I now know everything about Byzantine Fault Tolerance
6. Still haven't fixed the original bug

**Why I do this:**

- Curiosity is the best teacher
- You never know when random knowledge connects to solve a real problem
- Understanding fundamentals makes you a better developer
- It's fun (in a nerdy way)

**The downside:** I start a lot more research than I finish. My bookmarks folder is a graveyard of "I'll read this later" articles.

**The upside:** When someone mentions an obscure topic, there's a 50% chance I fell down that rabbit hole six months ago and can actually contribute to the conversation.
