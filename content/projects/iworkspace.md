# IWorkspace - The First Focus-First Agile Workspace

Context switching often feels like an unavoidable productivity killer—especially in fast-paced agile environments where multiple tools and tasks compete for attention. IWorkspace was born out of a personal breaking point during a critical sprint, where I found myself juggling 15 browser tabs and different project management systems. The headache of tracking story points across sprints and losing flow inspired a radical rethink: what if your tasks never disappeared? What if they floated persistently right above your work, without you needing to switch context?

## Overview

IWorkspace introduces a **focus-first approach** to enterprise agile management. It keeps sprint tasks visible and actionable throughout your workday through revolutionary floating windows that persistently display your current tasks, Pomodoro timer, and quick subtasks. This means teams can have enterprise-grade agile management tools without sacrificing individual flow and focus.

## Key Features

### Floating Focus Mode

Persistent floating task windows that show your current focus with a Pomodoro timer and quick subtask creation. These windows are always on top and Alt+Tab proof, ensuring you never lose sight of what matters during deep work sessions.

### Advanced Sprint Management

Complete support for sprint planning with story points, deadlines, real-time burndown charts, velocity tracking, and automatic spillover to product backlogs.

### Team Analytics & Collaboration

See instant story point visibility, heatmaps, team performance data, and efficient filtering to help teams stay aligned. Team collaboration is smooth via invites and integrated chat features.

### Desktop & Web Experience

Built with Electron for a powerful desktop app supporting deep OS integration (floating windows) alongside a responsive web interface for accessibility.

## How We Built It

Developed solo in 7 days using cutting-edge technologies:

- Bolt.new platform for rapid prototyping and deployment
- Next.js 15 with TypeScript for performant, type-safe frontend
- Supabase for Postgres-backed real-time data and authentication
- Electron for cross-platform desktop app with advanced window management
- TanStack Query for optimized caching and state synchronization

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Token Consumption:** Bolt.new’s code generation tokens were limited, pushing me to optimize prompts and write manual code for efficiency.
- **Floating Window Complexity:** Achieving persistent but non-intrusive floating windows across OSes required deep debugging of native APIs and Electron quirks.
- **Real-Time Sync:** Coordinating live updates from multiple users required advanced conflict resolution and network interruption handling.
- **Lack of Refresh/Rollback:** Without rollback in Bolt.new, I had to be meticulous and cautious before every architectural change.
- **Performance Tuning:** Optimized drag-and-drop Kanban interactions for smooth 60fps, even during complex multi-user updates.

## Lessons Learned

IWorkspace taught me the power and challenges of modern rapid development tools and AI assistance. The floating focus concept is a unique blend of productivity and enterprise needs. Using AI pair programming accelerated development, and consistent daily focus created a powerful feedback loop improving output and satisfaction.

## Results & Impact

- Delivered a functional, innovative agile workspace platform featuring floating focus windows.
- Enabled seamless sprint, task, and team management with strong analytics.
- Created a desktop experience that enhances focus and reduces context switching.
- Validated that enterprise agile and individual productivity can coexist effectively.

## What's Next

Plans include scaling performance for large teams, integrating popular tools (Slack, GitHub, Google Calendar), expanding AI-powered task prioritization and sprint planning, and enhancing the floating workspace with smart Pomodoro and calendar features. Mobile apps and enterprise SSO will broaden accessibility and security.
