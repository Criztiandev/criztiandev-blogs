# Kuripot Coach Mobile App

Building Kuripot Coach was a rewarding journey—an app created not just for budgeting, but to genuinely make money management chill and approachable for everyday Filipinos. This was more than just coding; it was about understanding real struggles and turning AI and smart automation into a friendly coach in your pocket.

## Overview

At its core, Kuripot Coach aims to help users hit their financial goals without feeling overwhelmed. Whether it's saving for a trip to Boracay or managing weekly bills and bonuses, the app adapts to how Filipinos actually handle money. The AI chat isn’t just a gimmick—it’s a buddy that talks you through your finances, making saving and budgeting feel less like a chore.

## Key Features

### AI Chat Coach and Goal Planner

Creating the AI chat interface was one of the most exciting parts. Designing it to offer personalized advice, based on real spending habits, brought the app to life. It’s like having a finance coach that’s available anytime, understands your habits, and helps you tweak your plan with a human touch.

### Real-Time Financial Insights

Users get dashboards that break down their spending, monthly balances, and bill reminders in ways that make sense—not just numbers but understandable stories about their money flow. This transparency helped people make smarter decisions without needing to be financial experts.

### Performance Boosts & Native Builds

Migrating from Expo to native builds was a game changer. Performance noticeably improved, and bugs that slowed users down quickly got chopped off. It showed how important the technical foundation is—not just bells and whistles but smooth, reliable app use.

### Smart Notifications & Automation

Automated payment scheduling and push reminders weren’t just about alerts—they reduced missed bills and helped users stay on track without stressing. Small touches like this can make a daily habit stick.

## What I Learned Along the Way

Working on Kuripot Coach taught me that good tech is only part of the equation; understanding users’ lifestyles and needs is just as crucial. Building AI that actually feels approachable required balancing complexity with simplicity—making sure advice was helpful without being overwhelming.

Another takeaway was how much native performance matters. The smoother the experience, the more likely users stick around and form good money habits. Also, collaborating with design and AI teams made me appreciate how cross-disciplinary teamwork shapes the final app.

## Challenges & How They Were Overcome

One tricky spot was handling the diverse financial behaviors typical in the Filipino market—weekly pay cycles, 13th month bonuses, and informal budgeting methods. Standard budgeting software didn’t fit well, so customization was key. That meant building flexible calculators and chat logic tailored to real user situations.

Hydration errors and slow navigation early on made the app feel clunky. Switching rendering strategies and introducing loading skeletons smoothed these rough edges and noticeably improved the user experience.

## The Big Picture Results

- Users engaged more deeply thanks to the friendly AI chat coach
- Cross-platform app performance became noticeably faster with native builds
- Automated reminders cut down late payments, easing users’ minds
- Dashboards empowered financially savvy decisions with real-time data
- And the best part? People actually felt less stressed about budgeting!
