# Schema Builder - Modern Database Schema Creation

Schema Builder is a versatile web application designed to simplify the process of creating and managing database schemas visually or through JSON, facilitating rapid development with immediate code generation. The project focused on bridging the gap between simple schema design and complex, type-safe code output, increasing developer productivity and reducing errors.

## Overview

Developers can build schemas with a friendly drag-and-drop interface or directly write JSON to define database structure. As schemas are crafted, the app instantly generates TypeScript interfaces, runtime Zod validation schemas, and database models compatible with both NoSQL (MongoDB/Mongoose) and SQL databases. This multi-format support eliminates manual syncing between schema design and codebase, accelerating development cycles.

## Key Features

### Visual Schema Builder and JSON Editor

Intuitive drag-and-drop UI backed by a Monaco editor for fuller control via JSON. Supports defining fields with types such as strings, numbers, booleans, dates, arrays, and nested objects.

### Real-time Code Generation

Instantly generates boilerplate for TypeScript interfaces, Zod validation, and database schemas as changes are made, providing live feedback and reducing development time.

### Advanced Validation and Type Safety

Generates smart defaults along with customizable validation rules including min/max values, regex patterns, unique constraints, and default values to ensure data integrity across applications.

### Modern UI Framework

Built with Next.js 13.5.1 using the App Router, styled with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI for accessible, polished components. Form handling is powered by React Hook Form integrated with Zod.

## Technical Stack

- Frontend Framework: Next.js 13.5.1 with App Router
- Programming Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- UI Components: Radix UI primitives
- Code Editor: Monaco Editor
- Form Handling: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Icons: Lucide React

## Developer Experience

The combination of visual schema building and live schema-to-code translation proved invaluable. The ability to visually design complex nested objects alongside immediate validation feedback minimized guesswork, prevented bugs early, and streamlined collaboration between frontend and backend teams.

## Getting Started

Cloning, installing dependencies, and running the development environment is straightforward, allowing developers to quickly dive into schema design and integration. The hosted live demo is accessible at [Schema Builder Demo](https://schema-builder-gilt.vercel.app/).

## Lessons Learned

Building this tool reinforced best practices in schema design, advanced validation techniques, and efficient form handling with React Hook Form and Zod. It also showcased the power of combining modern development tools like Next.js and Tailwind CSS to create developer-friendly, performant web apps.

## Future Directions

Plans include expanding database dialect support, enhancing UI with collaborative real-time schema editing, and integrating cloud deployment options to further simplify database schema workflows across teams and projects.
