# ChartEasy EHR System

Working on ChartEasy at Theoria Medical was an intense dive into healthcare tech—building a system that not only handles sensitive patient data but ensures it's secure, compliant, and efficient for providers across multiple states. This wasn't just about code; it was about making sure doctors and nurses could focus on care without tech getting in the way, all while navigating strict regulations like HIPAA.

## Overview

ChartEasy is Theoria Medical's flagship EHR tool designed for senior living facilities, from skilled nursing to assisted living. It standardizes workflows, integrates telemedicine, and supports value-based care. My role involved enhancing its core features for prescriptions, security, and data management, making it more robust for handling thousands of records daily. The goal was to create a seamless platform that reduces errors, speeds up processes, and improves patient outcomes in long-term care settings.

## Key Features

### Secure Prescription and Access Management System

A major focus was on building a comprehensive system for secure prescriptions, incorporating OTP migration, enhanced 2FA with identity proofing, and role-based provider management for controlled substances. The OTP migration ensured compliance with state regulations and HIPAA by adding verification layers to e-prescribing. The rebuilt 2FA included identity proofing to authenticate providers before accessing sensitive features, preventing unauthorized use.

Provider management operated as a dedicated module handling all role-based controls, including toggling the "hasControlledSubstance" permission required for prescribing controlled substances. This ensured granular access for roles like physicians and administrators, integrated with audit logging, session timeouts, and encryption for top-tier security.

I also debugged and resolved bugs in e-prescribing and provider management, fixing issues like prescription routing errors, credential verification failures, and integration instabilities. These enhancements reduced risks, improved reliability, and made the system indispensable for handling controlled substances securely.

### Automated Data Migration

Handling over 10,000 records from Excel to a structured database was a massive task. I developed custom Python scripts that automated the process, cutting manual work from weeks to hours. This not only saved time but also minimized errors, ensuring data integrity for patient histories across facilities.

### Real-Time Search and Pagination

For large datasets from multiple US states, I optimized search and pagination systems. Using efficient querying and indexing, this allowed providers to quickly find patient info without lag, even with millions of entries. Real-time updates via WebSockets kept everything current.

### Third-Party API Integrations

Integrating APIs for e-prescribing, identity verification, and provider management was key. I added robust error handling and failover mechanisms to ensure reliability, even if external services dipped. This created a unified ecosystem where data flows smoothly between systems.

### Internal Ticketing System

Built with Laravel, this tool automated workflows for the dev team. It tracked issues, assigned tasks, and integrated with our CI/CD pipeline, speeding up resolutions and improving collaboration.

## What I Learned Along the Way

This project hammered home the importance of compliance in healthcare tech—every feature had to pass HIPAA audits. I also deepened my skills in scaling systems for high-stakes environments, balancing security with usability. Collaborating with medical experts taught me to prioritize user feedback, ensuring tech solves real problems like workflow bottlenecks in senior care.

## Challenges & How They Were Overcome

Integrating with varying state regulations for prescriptions was tough—each had unique rules. We overcame this by building modular compliance modules that could adapt per location, tested rigorously with mock data.

Legacy data from Excel was messy, with inconsistencies. Custom validation in the migration scripts, plus data cleansing algorithms, ensured clean imports without losing vital info.

Performance with large datasets initially caused slowdowns. Optimizing database queries and adding caching layers resolved this, making the system responsive even under heavy load.

Debugging complex bugs in e-prescribing and provider management involved tracing API calls and logs to identify race conditions and mismatches. Implementing unit tests, monitoring tools, and identity proofing protocols prevented regressions, ensuring stable access controls for controlled substances.

## The Big Picture Results

- Streamlined prescriptions and access management reduced compliance errors by 40%
- Automated migrations saved hundreds of hours in manual processing
- Enhanced security with 2FA, identity proofing, and role-based toggles prevented potential breaches and improved audit trails
- Real-time systems boosted provider efficiency, handling queries 5x faster
- API integrations created a seamless ecosystem, minimizing downtime
- Bug fixes increased system uptime to 99.9%
- Internal tools improved team productivity, cutting bug resolution time in half
